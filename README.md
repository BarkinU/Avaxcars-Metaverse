- Inspired by ZED Run, this drag race game is fundamentally a car game where the cars’ counterparts in the system are NFTs.
Each one is unique, with 999 vehicles available in each collection. There are various attributes like colors, engines, tires, and rarity levels.
Map conditions, equipment, and a low chance percentage play a role in winning races. The map conditions and how well the vehicle matches the map greatly increase the chances of winning.

- After the project was completed, developers did not continue with the project due to the project owner’s desire to introduce a betting system into the game.
